# PairProgramming
Clay and Paul's Project

For this project we used the flask tool to help transfer a python 
application that collects book reading data. To collect this data we 
created an HTML form that collects book titles, the number of pages in a 
book, the author, classification and other data on a unique book.

We made our python app collect this data and send it to a table at the end
of our HTML page so the users get their results recorded 
nearly simultaneously.
